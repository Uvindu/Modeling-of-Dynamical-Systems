This report introduces the mathematical phenomenon, practical applications and our practical of the vibration. Vibration is an oscillation of a rigid body from a position of equilibrium.

I explained about five applications of mechanical vibration. Such applications are mobile phonesâ€™ vibration, vibratory plate compactor, vibrations of musical instruments, vibrating screens and uses of vibration in medical field. After that I described the basic vibration in an automobile travelling on a wavy road is due to forced vibrations, dumping, resonance and natural frequency. The nature of the practical session also proven using mathematics. Finally identified the practical issues and errors encountered during the practical and discuss the possible remedies to overcome the practical issues encountered.
